Sample Scenario:
	Ahmet is a 9th grade student who is just starting high school. In previous years he was very successful at school and his exam scores were very high. However, with the passing to high school, Ahmet's number of courses has increased. In order for Ahmet to continue his success in previous years, he has to organize his homework and grades in his classes. This organization will prevent him from forgetting his homework in classes and will enable him to better follow his courses. That's why Ahmet downloads the mobile application School Task to his phone. Thanks to the option of adding courses in the application downloaded to his phone, he can add the courses of this term to the phone. Ahmet also can add the homeworks given in this courses as soon as the teacher gives the homework. In this way, Ahmet can organize his course tasks better. In addition, thanks to the function to add a course schedule, Ahmet can be prepared for the courses of the day in advance. Thus his productivity in the day raises.
